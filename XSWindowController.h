/*!
 
 The object that will serve as the root for building the patched responder chain.
 This will generally either be the NSWindowController or NSWindow instances or nil (default).
 If set to an object other than any of the above than a warning is logged.
 
 If the property value is nil then responder patching begins at the window rathe than the window controller.
 
 Defaults to nil even though this breaks compatibility with previous versions.
 To me it seems more logical to have the window controller queried after its child view controllers.

 If YES then controllers are added to the responder chain starting with the furthest child.

 Searching up through the view controllers in the same order as the views that
 they manage seems to make more sense to me.
