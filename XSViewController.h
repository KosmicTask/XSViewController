/*!
 
 The windowController property must resolve to an instance of XSWindowController in order for
 controllers to be patched into the responder chain.
 
 This property can be set explicitly during initialisation or later.
 Alternatively the property will be set automatically when it is added as a child responder.
 
 Commonly view controllers are instantiated in -awakeFromNib and may have no access to a window.
 If a given view controller has a nil -windowController then it requests the root controllers -windowController instance.
 
 Therefore, any given tree of controllers will be patched into the responder chain as long as the root controller
 has a valid window controller reference.
