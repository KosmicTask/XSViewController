 This method is not used in the example but does demonstrates an important

 this method must be modified to check the class of the parent object.

 A top-down tree sorting method.

 Any manual KVO or bindings that you have set up (other than to the representedObject)

 without any warnings that it is being deallocated while observers are still registered.
